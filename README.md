# Quantitative Job Trends

## Description:
The aim of this project is to create a job market analytics tool. To this end, online job postings are scraped using Python and stored in Amazon S3 as json objects. Each documnet contains job title, company name, job description, city, geo location, date and job posting url. These json files are then ingested into Elasticsearch. Kibana is used as the dasboard.
