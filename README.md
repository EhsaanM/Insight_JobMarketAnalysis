# Insight_JobMarketAnalysis

## Description:
The aim of this project is to create a job market analytics tool. To this end, online job postings are scraped using Python and stored in Amazon S3 as json objects. Each documnet contains job title, company name, job description, city, geo location, and job posting url. They are then ingested into the Elasticsearch. Kibana is used as the visualization tool.
